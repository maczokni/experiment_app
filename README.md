# Mobile app for self-reporting worry about crime

This native android mobile application, programmed in Java, is a tool used in a laboratory experiment carried out as part of a British Academy funded project called "Measuring fear of crime using app-based and sensing methodologies".

The application has three buttons for the participant to press, a "start" and "finish" button to indicate the start and end of the experiment, and a "worry" button, which they were instructed to press every time they would feel worried about their personal safety. 

More information about the project is available on [https://rekadata.site/research/ba_fearofcrime/](https://rekadata.site/research/ba_fearofcrime/).
